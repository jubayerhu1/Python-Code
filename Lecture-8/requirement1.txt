The requirements.txt file in Python is a plain text file that lists all the external Python packages and their specific versions required by a particular project. 
Its primary purpose is to ensure that anyone working on or deploying the project can easily replicate the exact development environment by installing the necessary dependencies. 

Here's why requirements.txt is crucial:

Dependency Management: It provides a clear and concise record of all the project's dependencies, preventing the need to manually track and install each one.
Environment Consistency: By specifying exact package versions, it ensures that the project runs consistently across different machines and environments, minimizing compatibility issues.

Reproducibility: It enables easy setup and deployment of the project, as the required packages can be installed with a single command.

Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a standardized way to share and manage project dependencies.

How to use requirements.txt:
Creation: You can manually create a requirements.txt file and list the package names and versions (e.g., pandas==1.3.2, numpy>=1.21.0). Alternatively, you can use pip freeze > requirements.txt to automatically generate a file containing all currently installed packages in your environment.
Installation: To install the packages listed in a requirements.txt file, 

example:
----------------
pandas
mumpy

-------------------

or 
pandas==1.3.2
numpy==1.4.1


use the command to install:
pip install -r requirements.txt


pip uninstall -r to_remove.txt
  
  note : -r means read
---------------------
install :
pip install pandas
uninstall:
pip uninstall pandas
